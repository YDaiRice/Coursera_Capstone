## Investigation of Houston and New York---	A City Preview for City Migrant and Business Investor 

1. Summary: In this report, to show an example of helping people “see” the city before they move, I compared two biggest cities in USA, Houston and New York. The venues information is used for visualizing city’s neighborhood functionality.  Venue super category is defined to better represent overall impression of neighborhood. Using k-mean clustering method, I summarized neighborhoods in to 4 neighborhood clusters for each city and used ratio of venues in each super category to discuss neighborhood properties. While the neighborhoods in different clusters are mixed and close to each other in New York, they are spatially separated in Houston. This will affect the people’s daily life.
